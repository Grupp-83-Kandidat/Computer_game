  - These logic gates wont fix themselfs
  - WHAT?!?! You really dont understand how it works?
  - 'Alright alright ill explain it, but you better get it. '
  - Listen up! A logic gate takes two inputs, in this case two wires that conduct
    electricity, and allows the electricity to flow through it depending on if none,
    one or both of the wires are conducting electricity.
  - Following so far?
  - Hmmm we will see about that...
  - Wether a wire is conducting electricity or not can be seen as a 1 or 0, a 1 if
    it is conducting and a 0 if it is not.
  - 'So the gate gets a combination of two one''s or zero''s, HUAH HUAH HUAH A ZERO!!!
    Just like you.

    *cough* *cough* Anyway...

'
  - 'There are a bunch of different so called "Logic gates".

    One of which is
    the "AND" gate. It allows electricity through(The output becomes a 1) if both
    the inputs are 1. '
  - Or the "OR" gate, which allows electricity through if one or both of the connected
    wires are a 1.
  - If you forget you can have a look in the instruction manual at the top left corner.
    But dont dally too long.
  - NOW GET TO WORK!!!!
